# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
This repository hosts a simple Astro + React web app deployed to Cloudflare Pages.

## Package manager policy
- Use `pnpm` only.
- Do not use `npm` commands.
- Do not commit `package-lock.json`.

## Local commands
- Install: `pnpm install`
- Dev: `pnpm dev`
- Test: `pnpm test`
- Build: `pnpm build`
- Preview: `pnpm preview`

## TDD workflow (required)
- For feature changes, write/adjust tests first.
- Follow red-green-refactor:
  1. Write a failing test.
  2. Implement minimal code to pass.
  3. Refactor with tests still green.

## Code expectations
- Keep components small and readable.
- Prefer explicit props and deterministic rendering.
- Keep tests focused on user-visible behavior.

## Cloudflare Pages notes
- Deploy build output generated by Astro.
- Ensure build settings match project scripts.
